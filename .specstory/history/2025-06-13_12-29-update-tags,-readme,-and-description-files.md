I'll help you update your tags, readme, and description files. Let me first explore your workspace to understand the project structure and current state of these files.

I can see there are already `README.md`, `TAGS.md`, and `DESCRIPTION.md` files. Let me examine these files along with some project details to understand what needs to be updated.

---

Read file: README.md

---

Read file: TAGS.md

---

Read file: DESCRIPTION.md

---

Read file: VERSION.md

---

Read file: UndoRedo.sln

| 📁 `bin` |
| 📄 `UndoRedo.Core.csproj` |
| 📄 `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` |
| 📄 `DelegateCommand.cs` |
| 📄 `BaseCommand.cs` |
| 📁 `Services` |
| 📁 `Models` |
| 📁 `Contracts` |

</details>

---

Now, let me check the project file to understand more about the package configuration:

---

Read file: UndoRedo.Core/UndoRedo.Core.csproj

---



---

Let me also check the Directory.Packages.props file to see package management details:

---

Read file: Directory.Packages.props

---

Now I have a good understanding of the project. Based on the README content and project structure, this is **ktsu.UndoRedo** - a comprehensive .NET library for implementing undo/redo functionality. The current `TAGS.md` and `DESCRIPTION.md` files are just placeholders that need to be updated. Let me update all three files:

---

```diff
- Placeholder description, a single line concise description of the project, suitable for the package description in the nuget list UI.
+ A comprehensive .NET library for implementing undo/redo functionality with advanced features including save boundaries, change visualization, and external navigation integration.
  
```

---

```diff
- placeholder tags;use semicolons to separate tags;and spaces to separate words;
+ undo;redo;command pattern;stack;change tracking;save boundaries;navigation;async;dotnet;csharp;library;ui integration;command merging;composite commands;events;visualization
  
```

---



---

Now let me read the rest of the README to see if it needs any updates, then check if there are any missing sections or outdated information:

---

Read file: README.md

---



---

Let me check if there's a CHANGELOG to see what version 1.0.2 includes:

---

Read file: CHANGELOG.md

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully updated the files. Let me also verify the current package version in the README matches the VERSION.md file. The README looks comprehensive and current. Let me check if there are any additional features mentioned in the changelog that might need to be reflected in the README:

I can see that the project has extensive serialization functionality that was added in version 1.0.1 according to the changelog, but this isn't mentioned in the README. Let me add a serialization section to make the README more comprehensive and current:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully updated all three files:

## Summary of Updates:

### 1. **DESCRIPTION.md** ✅
- Replaced placeholder text with a professional, concise description suitable for NuGet package listing
- New description: "A comprehensive .NET library for implementing undo/redo functionality with advanced features including save boundaries, change visualization, and external navigation integration."

### 2. **TAGS.md** ✅ 
- Replaced placeholder tags with relevant, descriptive tags for the undo/redo library
- New tags: `undo;redo;command pattern;stack;change tracking;save boundaries;navigation;async;dotnet;csharp;library;ui integration;command merging;composite commands;events;visualization`

### 3. **README.md** ✅
- Added a new "Serialization and Persistence" section that documents the serialization features added in v1.0.1
- Includes examples of:
  - Setting up JSON serializer
  - Saving/loading stack state
  - Implementing custom serializable commands
- This makes the README more comprehensive and up-to-date with current functionality

All files now accurately reflect the current state of the ktsu.UndoRedo library (version 1.0.2) and provide clear, professional documentation for users and package managers.
