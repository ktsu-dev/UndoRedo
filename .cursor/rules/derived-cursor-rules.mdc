## PROJECT RULES & CODING STANDARDS

This document outlines the rules, coding standards, workflow guidelines, and best practices for all projects. It serves as the central reference for the AI coding assistant and all developers involved.

*   Adhere to SOLID and DRY principles.
*   Use dependency injection.
*   Employ a contacts, models, and services architecture.

## TECH STACK

*   .NET (Specify version as needed)

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

*   All projects must have a solution file (.sln).
*   Include a `docs` directory for design documentation.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

## DEBUGGING

When running tests, use the following commands:

*   `dotnet restore` to restore dependencies.
*   `dotnet build` to build the project.
*   `dotnet test` to run tests. Use `--nologo` to suppress the banner.
*   `dotnet test --verbosity normal --logger "console;verbosity=detailed" | cat` for verbose output.
*   If facing terminal output issues, check build outputs in `/bin/Debug/net9.0/` to confirm successful build and test execution.
